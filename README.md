Sir,

I’ve been trying to complete my Android Studio project, but I’ve faced multiple technical issues that made it difficult to continue.

Initially, the installation gave errors like “Failed to download SDK components” and often got stuck at steps like “Installing SDK tools” or “Fetching components.” I tried switching networks and reinstalling several times, but the problem kept repeating.

At one point, I did manage to get it working, and everything was running fine. I was even able to complete and submit a few assignments. But later, due to storage issues on my laptop, I had to update Windows and reinstall all my software, including Android Studio. After that, the setup got disturbed again and hasn’t worked properly since.

On top of that, Gradle sync keeps failing, and I haven’t been able to build or run any app. I tried different solutions online, but nothing helped. Also, my laptop isn’t very powerful, so Android Studio runs slowly and sometimes crashes.

Because of all this, I couldn’t complete the project. If allowed, I would like to submit something like a UI design in Figma or the XML layouts to show the effort I’ve made.

Thank you for understanding.
